Step 1. Run ./instaserver child my-server.
Step 2. mv my-server into the directory you want to serve.
Step 3. cd there and run ./my-server.

Your directory will be served on 0.0.0.0:8080. A special URL, 'proxy',
is provided for external requests; e.g:

  http://localhost:8080/proxy/www.google.com/   # retrieves Google

You can create aliases to /proxy/ to provide passthroughs to other
services. See the Montenegro documentation for information about how
to code it. The Javascript file creating the server can be accessed
like this:

  ./my-server edit js::server

From there you can customize the server initialization.
